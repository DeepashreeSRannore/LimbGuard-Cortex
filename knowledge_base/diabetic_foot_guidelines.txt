Diabetic Foot Care and Gangrene Management Guidelines
======================================================

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
Diabetic foot complications are a leading cause of non-traumatic lower-limb
amputations worldwide.  Early detection and proper management of foot ulcers
and gangrene can significantly reduce amputation rates.

2. CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETIC FOOT GANGRENE
--------------------------------------------
Grade 0 (Normal / At Risk):
  - No active ulceration but risk factors present (neuropathy, deformity).
  - Preventive care: daily foot inspection, proper footwear, blood sugar
    control.

Grade 1 (Superficial Ulcer):
  - Partial- or full-thickness ulcer not involving deeper structures.
  - Management: offloading, moist wound dressings, infection surveillance.
  - Follow-up within 1-2 weeks.

Grade 2 (Deep Ulcer):
  - Ulcer extending to tendon, bone, or joint capsule.
  - Requires radiographic evaluation (X-ray or MRI) to assess depth.
  - Antibiotic therapy if signs of infection are present.
  - Referral to wound care specialist.

Grade 3 (Abscess / Osteomyelitis):
  - Deep infection with abscess formation or bone involvement.
  - Urgent surgical consultation for debridement.
  - Intravenous antibiotics.
  - Hospitalization often required.

Grade 4 (Gangrene of Forefoot / Partial Foot):
  - Necrosis of a portion of the foot.
  - Emergency vascular surgery consultation.
  - Possible amputation of affected part to prevent spread.
  - Aggressive revascularization where feasible.

3. PREVENTIVE SELF-CARE FOR DIABETIC PATIENTS
----------------------------------------------
Blood Sugar Management:
  - Maintain HbA1c below 7% (or individualized target).
  - Monitor fasting and post-prandial glucose daily.
  - Follow prescribed medication regimen.

Foot Hygiene:
  - Wash feet daily with lukewarm water; dry thoroughly.
  - Apply moisturizer to prevent cracking (avoid between toes).
  - Trim toenails straight across to avoid ingrown nails.

Footwear:
  - Wear properly fitting shoes with adequate toe room.
  - Use diabetic-specific insoles if recommended.
  - Never walk barefoot, even indoors.

Regular Examinations:
  - Annual comprehensive foot exam for all diabetic patients.
  - Every 3-6 months for patients with neuropathy or PAD.
  - Immediate evaluation for any new wound, blister, or color change.

4. WHEN TO SEEK EMERGENCY CARE
-------------------------------
  - Sudden onset of severe pain in the foot or leg.
  - Foot turns black, blue, or dark red.
  - Foul-smelling discharge from a wound.
  - Fever above 100.4°F (38°C) with a foot wound.
  - Inability to bear weight on the affected foot.
  - Rapid spreading of redness around a wound.

5. TREATMENT MODALITIES
------------------------
Conservative:
  - Wound debridement and dressing changes.
  - Offloading (total contact cast, removable walking boot).
  - Topical and systemic antibiotics as indicated.

Surgical:
  - Incision and drainage of abscesses.
  - Bone resection for osteomyelitis.
  - Revascularization (angioplasty, bypass surgery).
  - Amputation as last resort.

Advanced Therapies:
  - Hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
  - Negative pressure wound therapy (wound VAC).
  - Growth factor application.
  - Bioengineered skin substitutes.
