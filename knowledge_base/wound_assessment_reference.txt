Wound Assessment and Management Reference
==========================================

1. WOUND ASSESSMENT
--------------------
Size and Depth:
  - Measure length, width, and depth in centimeters.
  - Document wound bed composition: granulation, slough, eschar, necrotic.
  - Photograph for longitudinal tracking.

Wound Edges:
  - Assess for undermining and tunneling.
  - Note if edges are attached, rolled, or macerated.

Surrounding Skin:
  - Check for erythema, induration, warmth, and edema.
  - Assess skin turgor and moisture level.

Signs of Infection:
  - Classic signs: redness, warmth, swelling, pain, purulent drainage.
  - Systemic signs: fever, elevated WBC, malaise.
  - Biofilm: slimy appearance on wound bed despite regular cleaning.

2. WOUND CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS
---------------------------------
Wagner Classification (commonly used for diabetic foot ulcers):
  Grade 0: No open lesion; deformity or cellulitis may be present.
  Grade 1: Superficial diabetic ulcer.
  Grade 2: Ulcer extending to ligament, tendon, joint capsule, or fascia.
  Grade 3: Deep ulcer with abscess, osteomyelitis, or joint sepsis.
  Grade 4: Gangrene of forefoot.
  Grade 5: Extensive gangrene requiring major amputation.

University of Texas Classification:
  Stages A-D crossed with Grades 0-3 for more nuanced assessment.

3. DRESSING SELECTION
----------------------
  - Clean, granulating wounds: hydrocolloid or foam dressings.
  - Infected wounds: antimicrobial dressings (silver, iodine).
  - Heavily exudative wounds: alginate or hydrofiber dressings.
  - Dry/necrotic wounds: hydrogel to promote autolytic debridement.

4. OFFLOADING STRATEGIES
--------------------------
  - Total contact cast (gold standard for plantar ulcers).
  - Removable cast walkers with adherence monitoring.
  - Therapeutic footwear for healed ulcers to prevent recurrence.

5. VASCULAR ASSESSMENT
------------------------
  - Ankle-brachial index (ABI): normal 1.0-1.3; <0.9 suggests PAD.
  - Toe pressures and transcutaneous oxygen measurements.
  - Duplex ultrasound for anatomical assessment.
  - Angiography if revascularization is being considered.
